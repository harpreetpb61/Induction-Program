He explained that millets are nutritious, gluten-free grains that are great for health and can help combat lifestyle diseases. Shaffy Makkar also shared simple and practical cooking methods, making it easy for us to include millets in our daily diet.

I believe learning about millets is very useful, especially today when healthy eating habits are so important. Including millets in our meals not only supports good health but also promotes sustainable farming practices. It was inspiring to see how small changes, like choosing millets over processed grains, can make a big difference in our well-being. This lecture motivated me to be more conscious about my food choices and try cooking millets at home.
