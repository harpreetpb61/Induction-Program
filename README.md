## Day 1 ( 30 August 2025 ) , Wednesday

Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana started its Induction Programme 2025 for the new B.Tech students. The event was a mix of tradition, motivation, and warm welcomes for the freshers from Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Electronics & Communication, Robotics & Artificial Intelligence.

The day started with Shabad kirtan at Gurudwara Sahib.

### 1. Granthi Ji :
The day began with a peaceful Path and Kirtan at the college Gurudwara Sahib. The Granthi Sahib addressed us with motivating words, guiding us to always respect and take care of our parents. He explained that there are three types of children:

Puttar – an ordinary child.

Suputtar – a good and obedient child who respects parents, works hard, and brings pride to the family.

Kuputtar – a disrespectful child who ignores values and causes pain to parents.


He encouraged us to always aim to be suputtar in life through discipline, honesty, and respect. His words left a deep impression on all of us.

### 2. Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HoD Applied science)
She welcomed all of us warmly and explained how important it is to build a strong academic base in our college years. She also encouraged us to make the most of the different opportunities GNDEC offers.

She talked about the structural freedom we will get here – meaning we have the chance to explore different activities, ideas, and learning styles instead of only sticking to the classroom routine. She said it’s our responsibility to use this freedom in a positive way to grow both academically and personally.
